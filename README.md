------------------------------------------------------------

Traffic congestion is one of the most persistent challenges in modern cities, affecting productivity, increasing fuel consumption, and contributing to pollution.
The Data Driven Traffic Prediction AI project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can forecast traffic speeds using a 
synthetic dataset that simulates real‑world road conditions.
By training advanced AI models and deploying them in a user‑friendly web application, the project makes traffic forecasting accessible to both technical and non‑technical users. The system allows anyone to input or generate sample traffic data and instantly view predictions in both numerical and graphical formats.
