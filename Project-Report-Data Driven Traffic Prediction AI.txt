1. Executive Summary

Traffic congestion is one of the most persistent challenges in modern cities, affecting productivity, increasing fuel consumption, and contributing to pollution. The Data Driven Traffic Prediction AI project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can forecast traffic speeds using a synthetic dataset that simulates real‑world road conditions.

By training advanced AI models and deploying them in a user‑friendly web application, the project makes traffic forecasting accessible to both technical and non‑technical users. The system allows anyone to input or generate sample traffic data and instantly view predictions in both numerical and graphical formats.
2. Objectives

    Predict future traffic speeds using AI trained on synthetic traffic data.

    Evaluate multiple AI models (ST-GCN, DCRNN, Graph WaveNet) to identify the most effective approach.

    Deploy the best model in a simple, interactive web application.

    Communicate clearly how the system benefits everyday users, not just technical experts.

3. Why This Project Matters

    Commuters: Can anticipate traffic jams and plan better routes.

    City Planners: Gain insights into congestion patterns to improve road design and traffic light scheduling.

    Ride-Sharing & Logistics Companies: Optimize pickup times and delivery routes.

    Researchers & Learners: Access a practical demonstration of how AI can be applied to real‑world problems.

4. How the System Works

    Data Simulation: Synthetic traffic data represents speeds across hundreds of road sensors.

    Model Training: AI models learn patterns in traffic flow over time and across locations.

    Prediction: Users provide traffic data (or generate sample data), and the AI forecasts future speeds.

    Visualization: Results are displayed as raw numbers and as an easy‑to‑read line chart for clarity.

5. Real‑World Example: Dhaka Rush Hour

Imagine it’s 7:47 AM in Dhaka, when thousands of people are heading to work or school. Traffic speeds drop sharply on busy roads like Mirpur Road, Airport Road, and Gulshan Avenue. By feeding recent traffic data into this app, the AI can predict how congestion will evolve in the next 30–60 minutes.

    Commuters: Check forecasts before leaving home and choose less congested routes.

    Ride‑Sharing Drivers: Anticipate slowdowns and adjust pickup times.

    City Planners: Use predictions to design better traffic light schedules or rerouting strategies.

This shows how the app is not just a technical demo — it’s a tool that could make daily life smoother in a busy city.
6. Outcomes

    Successfully trained and evaluated three AI models.

    Deployed the best performer (ST-GCN) in a FastAPI web application.

    Created a homepage that explains the system in plain language, includes a step‑by‑step guide, and provides an interactive demo.

    Enabled non‑technical users to engage with AI predictions through simple inputs and visual charts.

7. Conclusion

The Data Driven Traffic Prediction AI project demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to address real‑world urban challenges. By combining advanced models with a user‑friendly interface, the system bridges the gap between technical innovation and everyday usability.

This project highlights how AI can support smarter cities, improve daily commuting experiences, and serve as an educational tool for those interested in the future of data‑driven decision making.
